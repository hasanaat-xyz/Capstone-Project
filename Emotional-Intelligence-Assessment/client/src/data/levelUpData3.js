  { // ðŸ’­ Reading Emotions
    question: "1. A usually cheerful friend has gone quiet and insists theyâ€™re 'just tired.' Whatâ€™s your response?",
    options: [
      "You gently note that youâ€™ve noticed a shift, and they can reach out when theyâ€™re ready.",
      "You back off, if they wanted to talk, they would have.",
      "You say 'okay' but keep subtly checking on them with humor or small talk.",
      "You start sharing one of your own struggles so they might feel safe to open up."
    ],
    answer: 0, // awareness + space + safety = real empathy
  },

  { // ðŸªž Perspective-Taking
    question: "2. You give a teammate feedback meant to help, but they go silent and distant. Whatâ€™s your most empathic next step?",
    options: [
      "Ask them directly if you offended them, itâ€™s better to clear the air immediately.",
      "Acknowledge that your words may have landed wrong and invite their perspective calmly.",
      "Give them space for a while; if they value the feedback, theyâ€™ll come around.",
      "Lighten the mood by complimenting them right after, to balance the energy."
    ],
    answer: 1, // empathy = accountability + curiosity, not control or repair urgency
  },

  { // ðŸ§  Emotional Boundaries
    question: "3. A close friend repeatedly vents to you and you feel emotionally heavy afterwards. Whatâ€™s your best action?",
    options: [
      "Start limiting your replies so they understand youâ€™re not available emotionally.",
      "Keep listening quietly; they might just need consistency right now.",
      "Offer constant advice, thatâ€™s the most helpful thing you can do long-term.",
      "Tell them honestly that you care but need small breaks sometimes, emotional balance helps both of you.",

    ],
    answer: 3, // real empathy = connection + boundary, not avoidance or fixing
  },

  { // ðŸ’¬ Relationship Dynamics
    question: "4. Someone close to you grows emotionally distant and unresponsive over time. Whatâ€™s your best response?",
    options: [
      "Match their distance to protect your self-respect, you canâ€™t chase energy.",
      "Try to reconnect by reminding them of how good things used to be.",
     "Ask with calm curiosity if something shifted, and share your own feelings without demanding theirs.",
      "Overthink quietly, maybe they just need time and you shouldnâ€™t disrupt that."
    ],
    answer: 2, // grounded vulnerability + curiosity = high-EQ empathy
  },

  { // ðŸ§© Conflict & Compassion
    question: "5. During a disagreement, the other person starts crying unexpectedly. Whatâ€™s the most emotionally intelligent move?",
    options: [
      "Acknowledge the emotion, pause, and ask if theyâ€™d prefer to continue later or take a moment.",
      "Immediately comfort them and apologize repeatedly, emotions matter more than logic.",
      "Stay focused and finish your point, otherwise theyâ€™ll always cry to end arguments.",
      "Go silent out of respect; itâ€™s their process, not your place to interfere."
    ],
    answer: 0, // empathy = emotional attunement + shared regulation, not rescue or retreat
  },
